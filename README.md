Convolution Neural Network to Classify Street Signs

The freedom of the open road. Many people truly enjoy the overall driving experience. I personally feel engaged while driving a manual transmission on a winding country road. Yet that same experience in stop and go urban traffic is not so pleasant. While driving enthusiast will always have their niche, the raw idea of basic transportation is changing. Rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft are already changing how we approach basic transportation. Mainstream use of driverless vehicles is soon to follow.

Autonomous cars are on their way and will be an integral component to the transportation industry before too long. The task is to make them safe, reliable, and dependable for their acceptance as a viable transportation option. One of the major components to an autonomous car’s safety is for image recognition from the vehicle’s CPU. Therefore, the focus of this project is to detect road signs from images taken from German roads. The datafile of interest is “GTSRB – German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark” on Kaggle.com. https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign.

Datafile:
Single-image, multi-class classification problem
43 classes
Over 50,000 images
Task:
Write a Deep Learning, generalized Artificial Neural Network(ANN), classification model to identify street signs. I anticipated performing some initial data analysis, preprocessing, and proceed with fine tuning the deep learning component. I did not foresee the the time and effort I would have to invest in accessing the data, implementing a Convolution Neural Network(CNN), and all the issues that would present themselves due to computer limitations.

Stakeholders:
Anyone interested in safety of autonomous vehicles from auto manufacturers to government agencies to academics.

Challenges:
Along with the major ones discussed in the Task component, the biggest challenge for me was recognizing the power of Keras. Initially, I was attempting to do all the raw coding before my mentor, Jakob Solomonsson, directed me to a Keras article on building a categorical classifier from scratch. That advice refocused my direction into a big picture perspective that helped temendously.

Another issue I had was working with all the nuances of images. As with every project in this program, I have an idea going in without an initial full grasp of the material. A much clearer understanding of the process has developed after investigating concepts, testing code, and researching online to gain insights.
